# Security Policy (SECURITY.md)

## Security Policy
I maintain this project as an open source contributor in my spare time. While I take security seriously, my response times and ability to address issues may be limited.

### Reporting a Vulnerability
- For security issues, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- Provide a clear description of the vulnerability
- Include steps to reproduce if possible
- Allow up to 14 days for an initial response

I will do my best to address critical security issues in a timely manner, but cannot guarantee immediate fixes.
